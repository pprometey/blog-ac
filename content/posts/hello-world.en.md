For a long time I have been looking for a convenient and functional static site generator specialized specifically for blogging.
The main criteria is the ability to quickly add new articles by simply creating the necessary file in the required folder in the makrdown markup. The second criterion is the ability to search posts by tags and divide them into categories, and so that there is a large enough base of ready-made UI templates, I don't want to typeset a new theme from scratch. Choose from a large number of something that you like, finish a little and that's it.

And for over two years, for various purposes, I have been testing the most popular [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) - VuePress, Scully, Jekyll, GitBook, Docusaurus, MkDocs, Sphinx, DocFX, Gatsby, Metalsmith, Octopress, Pelican. But for blogging, I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). And I haven't found a better one yet. Simple enough, but it has a lot of flexibility, and out of the box it provides me with everything I need. In a day, I superficially figured out the generator, customized the theme and the result was this blog.

Welcome!
